# Profit-Optimized-Meal-Ordering-System

# System Overview

This system is composed of three main components: a Python API, C++ algorithms, and a React Native frontend.

## Python API

The Python API serves as the backbone of the system, providing a communication interface between the algorithms and the frontend. It is responsible for receiving requests from the frontend, processing them, and returning the appropriate response. The Python API is built using the Flask framework, which allows for easy integration with the C++ algorithms.

## C++

The C++ algorithms are the heart of the system, providing the necessary computational power to perform complex tasks. The algorithms are designed to be highly efficient and scalable, allowing for processing large amounts of data in real-time. The algorithms are integrated with the Python API using a combination of C++ libraries and Python bindings.

## React Native Frontend

The React Native frontend is the user-facing component of the system, providing a sleek and intuitive interface for users to interact with. It is built using React Native, a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile applications. The frontend communicates with the Python API using HTTP requests, allowing for seamless integration with the backend.
